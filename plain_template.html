		<p>A narrative. A spoken or written account of connected events. A story. </p>
		<p>The American education system is built around narratives. A curriculum that has been criticized by those with stories that are usually told incorrectly. But, these incorrect narratives can lead to a lack of confidence and low grades in the classroom, no matter the subject. </p>
		<p>High school graduation rates of Indigenous students are far lower than average. Indigenous students have a graduation rate of 67% compared to a national average of 80%. The percentage of Native students in higher education is even lower. </p>
		<p>Neal Powless, the Syracuse University Ombuds, believes there are many factors that add up to why Native students do not complete their educational career, end up unenrolling halfway through or aren’t considered in national data. </p>
		<p>He mentioned that many Indigenous students may take a fifth year to complete four-year programs due to many traditional reasons and often times, feeling like their voices go unheard in predominantly white classrooms - leading to a lack of participation and lower grades. </p>
		<p>But this is noticeable within each sector of education. When looking at data from the United States Census we can see an immense amount of young Indigenous adults and children that are not enrolled in school and a prevelant drop off between elementary school, middle school, high school, and college enrollment. </p>
		<p>Syracuse University sophomore and member of the Cayuga Nation, Eiza Capton says, “I think it can be uncomfortable being a Native student in the traditional classroom setting because sometimes I don't feel as if my opinions or my input would be taken seriously by my non-native classmates.”</p>
		<p>Neal Powless agrees - and it’s even worse when information about Indigenous peoples are taught in predominantly white classes. When speaking to him, he told multiple stories about professors and teachers incorrectly teaching Indigenous culture or docking Indigenous students’ grades due to their interpretation of certain historical topics. </p>
		<p>One story took place when Powless was an undergraduate student. He explained that the professor would teach incorrect and culturally sensitive content in class and once Powless complained, the professor lowered his grade.</p>
		<p>Powless says, “So, I proceeded to sulk and bemoan the rest of my semester in the class and I fudged my way through to a C... in Native Studies.” </p>
		<p>And while its been 15 years since Powless has been an undergraduate, things have yet to change. He says, “So here I am, sitting there, looking at these students and hearing stories that are exact replicas of what I went through in undergrad.”</p>
		<p>And he ended with a question, “how can an institution support a group of people that statistically is small in number, but massive in its impact?</p>

		<p>It’s no wonder that the lack of care for Indigenous students is rampant because even in the United States census, Indigenous students are not included in data relating to graduation rates. When doing research and creating charts, two different charts needed to be combined in order to compare rates among races.</p>
		<p>This isn’t surprising when faced with the fact that many spaces are not seen as places for Indigenous people. </p>
		<p>Thankfully, there are steps being taken to ensure Native students have a place in the classroom. </p>
		<p>In Upstate New York, the Akwesasne Freedom School has emerged as a school created by Indigenous people for Indigenous people. While the education is primarily focused on teaching Mohawl traditions and language, it’s a way for young students to be fully immersed in their culture. </p>
		<p>The Akwesasne School says it is creating “new generations of Mohawks who know and live in two societies and can bridge the gap between them.” </p>
		<p>The effect of living in two societies is exactly why Indigenous students have problems adapting to predominantly-white classrooms and universities, but the difference with the Akwesasne School is the fact that they are preparing them to enter the world that has always seen them as lesser than. </p>

		<p>This is something the Haudenosaunee in Syracuse attempted to create in 1980, but the New York State Education Department killed the 600-page elementary and high school Indigenous curriculum before it could be published. </p>
		<p>Powless asks, “what could have happened if starting in 1980: New York State K-12 students could have been and would have been exposed to a different narrative?”</p>
		<p>Now - fourty years later - elementary and high schools in Onondaga county rely on the Syracuse City School District Native Student program and its program director, Lori Smith to help students feel comfortable in the classroom. </p>
		<p>The program has been a part of the SCSD for 35 years now. It has 449 students that participate in cultural activities that help them embrace their Indigenous culture. The program teaches students their language, cultural traditions and even hosts field trips around the area.</p>
		<p>Lori Smith says the curriculum “makes [students] self aware of where they come from and who their people are and were.”</p>
		<p>Lori also believes the program helps students feel comfortable in the classroom. With the lack of correct Indigenous history being taught in schools, Native students are often scared to speak up and correct their teachers. Lori says “when [schools are] teaching social studies and [students are] learning about the Europeans [they’re] speaking up saying… ‘Excuse me miss, Christopher Columbus did not discover America.” She believes students who make use of the program have a newfound confidence.</p>
		<p>Native students have some solutions of their own, they’re just unsure if others would be willing to accept those changes.</p>
		<p>Capton says, “One solution would obviously be including Indigenous people in these discussions and not leaving us out. A broader solution would just be decolonizing our education system and the way we speak.” </p>
		<p>All in all, native students have hope. Hope that their narratives - That their stories of struggle can somehow inspire future generations of Native children to continue the fight.</p>
